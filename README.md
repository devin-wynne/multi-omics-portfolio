# multi-omics-portfolio
This repository contains two projects that showcase different aspects of my bioinformatics and data analysis experience.

1. RNA-seq + ChIP-seq Integration: a full multi-omics workflow exploring how chromatin state relates to gene expression changes conducting individual analysis on RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data and then integrating

2. RNA-seq Analysis: a more concise and streamlined RNA-seq pipeline developed for a graduate student’s project


All analyses were performed in R with additional preprocessing on Linux (FASTQ trimming, alignment, duplication removal, etc.).
